    Getting shopping list, department-to-products mapping and

     optimal way to go through the market.

    I.e. you need to buy bread, apples, milk and salami.
    Placement of departments inside store is
     Produce -> grocery -> deli -> bakery -> dairy
    So, optimal way to shop up is
     apples -> salami -> bread -> milk
    Possible calls for following schema:

    Department-product mapping and departments order may not be
